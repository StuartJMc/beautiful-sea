##DATA IN STREAMLIT EXAMPLE

# #Define load data function
# DATA_SCENARIO = 'scenario_forecasts.csv'
# @st.cache_data
# def load_scenario_data(nrows):
#     data = pd.read_csv(DATA_SCENARIO, nrows = nrows)
#     del data[data.columns[0]]
#     return data
##making sliders = st slider
##making categorical sliders = st select slider
##if using float slider, can use np.close to get the closest value from data to selection
    ##problem is an error pops up saying the filter is ambigous (need to mask the bool)
